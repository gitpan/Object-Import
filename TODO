TODO for Object::Import perl module

= bugs =

= features =
- options to exclude subs inherited from some packages,
    and maybe some defaults (like Exporter)
- options to exclude subs imported from some packages (like Carp, Scalar::Util, etc)
    and maybe some defaults (popular non-OO modules)
- maybe even an option to skip all functions compiled to other packages (and imported)?
- weak referencing the object:
    this can be done in two ways (deref on in both cases): 
    either with an option to make the functions keep only a weak reference to the scalar,
    or by the scalar being a weak object itself.  
- maybe make it so that methods with names conflicting with builtins are exported ucfirsted
    (this may not be a good idea)

= documentation =
- perl can dispatch methods to filehandles -- how does this come up in code and docs?

= distribution =

= external =
- examine how Symbol::Qualify doesn't work for non-ascii names, possibly patch and report
- write patches to B::Keywords
