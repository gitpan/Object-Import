TODO for Object::Import perl module

= features =
- options to exclude subs inherited from some packages,
    and maybe some defaults (like Exporter)
- options to exclude subs imported from some packages (like Carp, Scalar::Util, etc)
    and maybe some defaults (popular non-OO modules)
- maybe even an option to skip all functions compiled to other packages (and imported)?
- weak referencing the object:
    this can be done in two ways (deref on in both cases): 
    either with an option to make the functions keep only a weak reference to the scalar,
    or by the scalar being a weak object itself.  
- maybe make it so that methods with names conflicting with builtins are exported ucfirsted
    (this may not be a good idea)

= documentation =
- examples for deref
- fix example in docs for target option

= distribution =
- possibly put "DSL" in the NAME line of the pod (as in 'domain specific language'?)
- Corion: please look at the CREDITS section and decide 
    whether I'm giving you approperiate credit, what name you want to be credited under, 
    and whether you want an email address displayed.
    (please synchronize the CREDITS section in the .pm and the README)
- asked exussum0 what name he wants to see in the credits.

= external =
- examine how Symbol::Qualify doesn't work for non-ascii names, possibly patch and report
- write patches to B::Keywords
