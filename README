NAME

Object::Import - a perl module that lets you import methods of a perl
object or class to a package as plain functions.

USAGE

    use Object::Import $object;
    foo(@bar); # now means $object->foo(@bar);


See the pod documentation in the Object::Import module for more details
on how to use this module.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl version 5.8 or later is required to use this module.
If you have perl version 5.10.0 or later, you shouldn't need any more prerequisites to use this module.
Otherwise, you may need to install the following modules.

    mro OR MRO::Compat
    Scalar::Util
    Test::More *
    File::Temp *
    Math::BigInt *

(The modules marked with a star are needed only for testing.)

This is a pure perl module, so you won't need a C compiler to build it.

INSTALLING

First, you should get the latest release of the module from CPAN,
under the distribution name Object-Import.

After that, you can install the module like any other perl module that
uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  For example, use these commands.

   tar xzf Object-Import-1.VVV.tar.gz
   cd Object-Import-1.VVV
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Where 1.VVV is the version number of the module you've got.  

If you're not familiar with the procedure of installing a perl module,
you may want to read
